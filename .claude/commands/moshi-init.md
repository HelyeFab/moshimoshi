We're working on the moshimoshi project. Please:
1. Get the project summary from memory-man for moshimoshi
2. Search for key architectural memories about the Universal Review Engine
3. Load any recent decisions or important context
4. **VITAL**: Read these essential documentation files:
   - /home/beano/DevProjects/next_js/moshimoshi/docs/root/THEME_SYSTEM.md
   - /home/beano/DevProjects/next_js/moshimoshi/docs/root/UI_COMPONENTS.md

This will give us full context about the review engine architecture, SRS algorithm, validation system, theme system, UI components, and all stored project knowledge.
