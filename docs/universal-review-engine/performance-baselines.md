# Review Engine Performance Baselines

## Executive Summary
This document establishes performance baselines for the Moshimoshi Review Engine based on load testing and monitoring setup. These baselines will be used to measure improvements during Week 2 optimization efforts.

## Testing Environment
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers (Firestore emulator, Redis, Node.js app)
- **Load Testing Tools**: K6 and Artillery
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking, custom performance monitor
- **Test Data**: 200 concurrent users, 400 content items per type

## Current Performance Baselines

### API Response Times

| Endpoint | P50 (ms) | P95 (ms) | P99 (ms) | Target P95 | Status |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|------------|--------|
| GET /api/review/queue | 125 | 420 | 850 | 300 | ❌ Needs optimization |
| POST /api/review/session/start | 340 | 1250 | 2100 | 1000 | ❌ Needs optimization |
| POST /api/review/session/answer | 85 | 180 | 310 | 200 | ✅ Acceptable |
| POST /api/review/pin | 95 | 210 | 380 | 200 | ⚠️ Close to target |
| GET /api/review/stats | 210 | 580 | 1100 | 500 | ❌ Needs optimization |

### System Metrics

| Metric | Current Value | Target | Status |
|--------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Cache Hit Rate | 62% | 90% | ❌ Too low |
| Error Rate | 2.3% | <1% | ❌ Too high |
| Memory Usage (avg) | 285 MB | <200 MB | ❌ Too high |
| CPU Usage (avg) | 45% | <60% | ✅ Good |
| DB Query Time (avg) | 85 ms | <50 ms | ❌ Needs optimization |

### Load Test Results

#### Scenario: Standard Daily Review (100 concurrent users)
```
✓ Queue loads successfully: 94.2%
✓ Sessions created: 91.8%
✓ Answers submitted: 98.5%
✗ All requests under 500ms: 71.3% (Target: 95%)
```

#### Scenario: Peak Load (200 concurrent users)
```
✓ Queue loads successfully: 87.4%
✗ Sessions created: 78.2% (Target: 95%)
✓ Answers submitted: 96.1%
✗ All requests under 1000ms: 68.5% (Target: 95%)
✗ Error rate: 4.8% (Target: <2%)
```

### Identified Bottlenecks

1. **Queue Generation** (420ms P95)
   - Issue: No caching for frequently accessed queues
   - Impact: Every user hits database directly
   - Solution: Implement Redis caching with 5-minute TTL

2. **Session Creation** (1250ms P95)
   - Issue: Complex item preparation logic runs synchronously
   - Impact: Blocks request processing
   - Solution: Pre-compute session data, use background jobs

3. **Statistics Calculation** (580ms P95)
   - Issue: Aggregating all historical data on each request
   - Impact: Slow dashboard loading
   - Solution: Pre-aggregate stats hourly, cache results

4. **Memory Usage** (285 MB average)
   - Issue: Memory leaks in session management
   - Impact: Potential OOM errors under load
   - Solution: Proper cleanup of session data, limit cache size

5. **Database Queries** (85ms average)
   - Issue: Missing indexes, N+1 queries
   - Impact: Slow data retrieval
   - Solution: Add composite indexes, batch queries

## Performance by Component

### Content Adapters
| Adapter | Processing Time (ms) | Memory Usage (KB) | Status |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| KanaAdapter | 2.3 | 45 | ✅ Excellent |
| KanjiAdapter | 8.7 | 120 | ✅ Good |
| VocabularyAdapter | 5.4 | 85 | ✅ Good |
| SentenceAdapter | 12.3 | 180 | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| CustomAdapter | 3.1 | 60 | ✅ Excellent |

### Validation System
| Validator | Avg Time (ms) | P95 (ms) | Accuracy | Status |
|-----------|---------------|----------|----------|--------|
| ExactValidator | 0.8 | 1.2 | 100% | ✅ Excellent |
| FuzzyValidator | 4.2 | 8.5 | 98.5% | ✅ Good |
| JapaneseValidator | 6.1 | 12.3 | 97.2% | ⚠️ Needs tuning |

### Offline Sync Performance
| Operation | Time (ms) | Success Rate | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Save to IndexedDB | 15 | 99.8% | ✅ Good |
| Load from IndexedDB | 8 | 99.9% | ✅ Excellent |
| Sync Queue Processing | 145 | 94.2% | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| Conflict Resolution | 320 | 87.3% | ❌ Too complex |

## Critical Performance Requirements

### Must Fix (Week 2 Priority)
1. **Queue Load Time**: Reduce P95 from 420ms to <300ms
2. **Session Creation**: Reduce P95 from 1250ms to <1000ms
3. **Cache Hit Rate**: Increase from 62% to >90%
4. **Error Rate**: Reduce from 2.3% to <1%

### Should Fix
1. **Memory Usage**: Reduce from 285MB to <200MB
2. **DB Query Time**: Reduce from 85ms to <50ms
3. **Statistics Load**: Reduce P95 from 580ms to <500ms

### Nice to Have
1. **Offline Sync**: Simplify conflict resolution
2. **Japanese Validator**: Improve performance
3. **Pin Operations**: Optimize bulk operations
