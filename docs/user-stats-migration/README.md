# User Stats Migration Documentation

## Overview
Complete documentation for the user statistics migration from scattered Firebase collections to a unified single source of truth in the `user_stats` collection. This migration fixes data corruption issues and establishes a reliable system for tracking user progress, streaks, XP, and achievements.

## Documentation Contents
