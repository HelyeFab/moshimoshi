## Learning & Reviews

### How does the spaced repetition system work?
Our SRS algorithm shows you items just before you're likely to forget them. The intervals increase as you successfully recall items:
- First review: 1 day
- Second review: 3 days
- Third review: 7 days
- And so on...

### Why is my review queue empty?
Your queue may be empty because:
- You've completed all available reviews for today
- Items haven't reached their review time yet
- You need to add more content to learn
- Check back later when more reviews become available

### Can I review more than the daily limit?
Free users have a daily limit of 50 reviews. Premium users enjoy unlimited reviews. The limit resets at midnight in your local timezone.

### What do the difficulty buttons mean?
- **Again (1)**: You didn't remember - item will appear again soon
- **Hard (2)**: You struggled but remembered - shorter interval increase
- **Good (3)**: You remembered normally - standard interval increase
